Snakes
=======


## Why?:
Why spend all that time making boring text decoration in your terminal programs when you can use a snake! This program gives many options to make your project 'beautiful'.

## Install:

npm install -g snakes


## To use:

snakes(size, type, callback)


Size determines the length of the 'snake'. The type can be a few different options:
snake:  ««««««««««««««««««««««ºº>
stars:  .¤~**********~¤.
tTubes: ╔══════════╗
btubes: ╚══════════╝
joker: ¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?

Due to the differences in font size and spacing, you may need to play around with the size variable as it will differ depending on your setup.
